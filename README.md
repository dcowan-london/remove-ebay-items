# eBay Item Remover
This Chrome extension allows you to hide items from eBay search results.

## Notes
* Extension currently only works in Chrome
* Extension currently only works for eBay UK (https://ebay.co.uk)
* Currently, the only way to make a hidden item show again is to uninstall and reinstall the extension. This will reset it and make all items previously hidden show up in search results again.
* **IMPORTANT: If you currently have version 0.0.1, you must remove the extension before installing the new update**
